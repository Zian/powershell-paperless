These scripts will allow you to harness the power of Tesseract and PowerShell to sort scanned copies of documents. Or use OCR on any image in general.


##Usage

2. Run Initialize-Environment.ps1 - this will download the necessary libraries and extract the files to the correct locations
3. Run Sort-Images.ps1 with your directories
4. High five!
